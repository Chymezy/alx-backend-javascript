JavaScript Promises:

    A promise takes two parameters: resolve (for success) and reject (for failure).

    resolve and reject are used within the promise to signal success or failure.

    The .then() method is used to handle the successful outcome of the promise.
    
    The .catch() method is used to handle errors or rejections.
