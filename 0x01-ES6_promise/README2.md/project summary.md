ere's a concise summary of each task, including fundamental guidelines and examples:

1. Handling Promises

  

Task 1:

  

Fundamental: Use Promise.allSettled to handle multiple promises and get results for both fulfilled and rejected promises.

Example: Combine multiple asynchronous functions and process their results.

  

2. Formatting Results

  

Task 2:

  

Fundamental: Use .map() to format results from Promise.allSettled.

Example: Convert results to a desired format, including handling errors gracefully.

  

3. Error Handling Basics

  

Task 3:

  

Fundamental: Use try...catch to manage errors in asynchronous code.

Example: Catch and handle errors thrown during asynchronous operations.

  

4. Avoiding Duplication

  

Task 4:

  

Fundamental: Ensure function and variable names are unique within a file to avoid duplication.

Example: Use suffixes to differentiate between similar function names.

  

5. Basic Load Balancing

  

Task 5:

  

Fundamental: Return the result of the first resolved promise to simulate load balancing.

Example: Handle multiple download promises and return the result from the fastest one.

  

6. Throwing and Catching Errors

  

Task 6:

  

Fundamental: Use throw to generate custom error messages and try...catch to handle them.

Example: Throw an error for division by zero and catch it to prevent application crashes.

  

7. Guardrail Pattern

  

Task 7:

  

Fundamental: Implement a guardrail pattern to handle function results and errors consistently.

Example: Append results or error messages to a queue and add a final processing message.

  

8. Async/Await with Error Handling

  

Task 8:

  

Fundamental: Combine async/await with try...catch to manage multiple asynchronous functions.

Example: Return results from multiple async functions or handle errors if any function fails.

  

9. Advanced Error Handling

  

Task 9:

  

Fundamental: Handle errors from functions and return error messages appropriately.

Example: Use a guardrail approach to capture and manage errors from a function execution.

  

10. Function Composition with Async/Await

  

Task 10:

  

Fundamental: Combine async/await to handle results from multiple functions or return an empty object on failure.

Example: Call uploadPhoto and createUser, return their results, or handle failures by returning an empty object.

  

These tasks collectively cover fundamental concepts of promise handling, error management, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.
